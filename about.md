This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Alpine Entomology](https://alpineentomology.pensoft.net/).

**Alpine Entomology** publishes original research articles, reviews and short communications on insects and other arthropods from mountainous regions all over the world. Published articles may cover a diversity of topics, including taxonomy, phylogenetics, behavior, ecology, conservation and biogeography, provided that article content enhances current understanding of entomological fauna in mountainous areas. Studies using altitudinal gradients to investigate community structure and ecosystem processes anywhere across the globe are welcome. Upon request, larger monographs or special issues may also be published.

Alpine Entomology, in print since 2017, is the journal of the Swiss Entomological Society (formerly the "Journal of the Swiss Entomological Society", published from 1862 to 2016). Alpine Entomology is an open access journal, available both online and in print. The journal primarily publishes papers in English; however, manuscripts in German, French and Italian are also welcome, provided that they contain an English translation of the abstract. Members of the Swiss Entomological Society receive a printed copy of the year’s volume.
